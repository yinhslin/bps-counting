# bps-counting
Counting of 1/16 BPS states in 3+1d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills with SU(N) gauge group

Current progress:

N=2 n=25
N=3 n=19
N=4 n=15

Data is stored in cohomology_N.csv, with entries

n, #derivatives (5 entries), Y, N, #all, #multi-gravitons

A Mathematica notebook is provided for reading the data
