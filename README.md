# bps-counting
Counting of 1/16 BPS states and one-loop anomalous dimensions in 3+1d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(N)

BPS counting progress:

N=2 n=25
N=3 n=19
N=4 n=15

Data is stored in cohomology_N.csv, with entries

n, #derivatives (5 entries), Y, N, #all, #multi-gravitons

One-loop anomalous dimensions progress:

N=2 n=24
N=3 n=17
N=4 n=15
planar n=20

Data is stored in ad_N.csv, with entries (no N for planar)

n, #derivatives (5 entries), Y, N, anomalous dimensions

A Mathematica notebook is provided for reading the data
