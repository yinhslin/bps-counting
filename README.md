Counting of 1/16 BPS states in 3+1d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills with SU(N) gauge group

Current progress:

N=2 level=24
N=3 level=19
N=4 level=15

Data is stored in cohomology_N.csv, with entries

level, charges (5 entries), degree, N, all, multi-graviton

A Mathematica notebook is provided for reading the data
